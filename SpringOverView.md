## Why Spring:  

* Light weight development with Java POJOs (Plain-Old-Java-Objects)   
* Dependency injection to promote loose coupling  
* Declarative programming with Aspect-Oriented-Programming (AOP)  
* Minimize boilerplate Java code  


## Core Containers:

* Beans  
* Core  
* SpEL 
* Context  

## AOP:  
Aspect Oriented Programming, Add functionality to objects declaratively. -Logging, security, transactions, etc…

## Data Access Layer:  
* JDBC  
* ORM: Object to Relational Mapping, Integration with Hibernate and JPA  
* JMS: Java Message Service, for sending async messages to a Message Broker. Spring provide helper classes for JMS
Transactions: Add transaction support: Makes heavy use of AOP behind the scenes.  


## Web Layer: (All Web related classes, Home of the Spring MVC framework) . 
* Servlet  
* WebSocket  
* Web  
* Portlet  

## Infrastructure: 
* e.g. (Java agents to remotely monitor your app with JMX(Java Management Extension)    

## Test Layer:  
* Supports Test-Driven-Development (TDD)  
* Mock objects and out-of-container testing
