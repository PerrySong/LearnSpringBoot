### Concept
[Spring Overview](https://github.com/PerrySong/LearnSpringBoot/blob/master/SpringOverView.md)  
[Intro to Inversion of Control and Dependency Injection with Spring](https://www.baeldung.com/inversion-control-and-dependency-injection-in-spring)  
[Java Bean](https://github.com/PerrySong/LearnSpringBoot/blob/master/JavaBean.md)  
[Annotation](https://github.com/PerrySong/LearnSpringBoot/blob/master/Annotation.md)

* Annotation: Annotations are primarily used by code that is inspecting other code. They are often used for modifying (i.e. decorating or wrapping) existing classes at run-time to change their behavior. Frameworks such as JUnit and Hibernate use annotations to minimize the amount of code you need to write yourself to use the frameworks.
